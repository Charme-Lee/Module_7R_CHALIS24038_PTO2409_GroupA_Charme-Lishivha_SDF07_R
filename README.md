# Code Along with the Build Your Portfolio MVP

This guide will walk you through the process of forking the Build Your Portfolio MVP starter code from GitHub, and then coding along with Scrimba's course using Visual Studio Code (VSCode). By the end of this guide, you will have a local development environment set up to work on your Portfolio MVP.

# My Project Overview:

In this exercise, I kept things simple by following along with the Scrimba course while making a few personalized adjustments. I added a box shadow to my images with a color that complements the overall theme, creating a cohesive look. The buttons were designed to invert colors and feature opacity effects, giving them a glowing appearance on hover.

Additionally, I customized the webpage theme and incorporated my own personal data throughout. All social links direct to my personal accounts, and the project links lead to external HTML pages.

I added only three pieces of course work because I am confident of my work and progess on these areas. When the projects are hovered the colors appears different due to my prefered changed. Additionally, I created my own logo just to give a personal touch.

Overall, this project was both fun and straightforward, allowing me to enhance my skills while adding my personal touch. I also do note that there were no additional materials required for this exercise.

Once you've completed and tested your app:

1. **Generate a Public Link:** If you've pushed your project to GitHub, your repository URL is what you'll need.
2. **Submit the link:** to your completed app viaÂ the Learning Management System (LMS) [**[Projects](https://learn.codespace.co.za/projects)**] tab.
